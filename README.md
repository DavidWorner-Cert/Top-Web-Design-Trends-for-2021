Technology is changing rapidly and web design trends are no different. Design elements and website features that were previously modern and innovative can become tired, overworked. The last thing you want when people come to your site is to lose a conversion because your site becomes obsolete or ignores important web standards.

Fortunately, the professional, experience and certified web design team keeps pace with the latest website design and development trends to create highly functional and easy-to-use websites that work well and look great. We want to share some of the latest innovations, digital technology trends, benchmarks and website design trends for 2021.

There will always be aspects of web design that never go away - your site needs easy navigation, data security and fast load times. However, you can put your site at the forefront of search engines and create some of these innovative sites by adding features and elements.

Site load time and page speed

Extremely fast load times are one of the most important criteria for web design. Fast load times have been a key part of UX and SEO for years, and remain a top priority for sites that want to rank well and convert better.

Research shows that more than half of web browsers expect a site to load quickly and no longer than two seconds after clicking a link. If your site takes more than three seconds to load, your visitors are more likely to leave and are less likely to return!

Accessibility and Availability

Uniqueness and accessibility are more than just a trend, but more and more web design is needed to take into account the needs of people with disabilities. Having a site that every visitor can navigate and interact with is more than a good part of customer service and provides a great experience. This can increase conversions, increase SEO and help reach a larger audience.

Elements that improve access include:

Create a strong color contrast between the text and the background;
Add focus indicators, such as rectangular charts that appear around a link, using the keyboard indicator;
Use features and help in form fields instead of low-reference placeholder text;
Use functional selection tags for images (which also improves SEO!)

3.	Chat robosts integration

Chat robots are another feature that has been popular for a few years and will remain relevant in 2021. As artificial intelligence and machine learning continue to evolve, we expect chat robots to become a simple customer service request and a "personalized shopping" norm. "

For example, if a customer visits your site, look for phone support and the chat robot knows they have a free phone upgrade. A robot chat program can teach them to upgrade. This can create a positive customer experience and save on customer support costs associated with talking to a live person.

4	Data Visualization 

Data visualization takes advantage of the fact that humans are visual beings, and it still conveys the message that needs to be sent. Visualizing data from your data creates images that engage readers and make them want to know more about your brand. Charts and diagrams are two of the most popular ways to revive data.

5	Smart video

Videos are always advertised as a site requirement. People love videos! The video is hilarious! This is the most effective online marketing tool! While the video is cool, you have to think about it. Smart video is everything: video with purpose and meaning. Gone is the only one to embed a YouTube video on your site. Thoughtful, high-quality video is better than a dozen randomly collected videos.

In 2021, visitors expect to see bright, eye-catching and easy to navigate websites that use the different animation and video to enhance the user experience.
